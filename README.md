The project aims to utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic images of glaucoma-affected eyes. Its purposes include expanding datasets for machine learning, balancing imbalanced data, enhancing deep learning model training, aiding medical research on glaucoma, addressing privacy concerns, and supporting medical education. Overall, the project seeks to improve glaucoma diagnosis, research, and education while considering data limitations and privacy issues.
